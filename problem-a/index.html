    <p> The fictional character I admire is
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man">Spider-Man.</a>
        He is from the Marvel Universe and his first appearance is in August 1962. Spider-Man's real identity is Peter Parker.
        He is a high school student from Queens, New York. Below are three reasons why I admire Spider-Man.
        <ul>
            <li>Spider-Man can shoot webs from his wrists.</li>
            <li>Spider-Man is not scared of spiders.</li>
            <li>Spider-Man's costume is really cool.</li>
          </ul>
    </p>
